PAPI 4.0.0 RELEASE NOTES                                            19 Jan 2010

cvs tree.


GENERAL NOTES
===============================================================================
This is the inaugural release of Component PAPI, or PAPI-C. It represents a 
significant architectural change from PAPI 3.7.x and earlier. As such, your 
application must be recompiled and relinked to libpapi, the PAPI library for 
this version to work.
PAPI-C is backward compatible with earlier versions of PAPI. All new library 
features are supported through new APIs and all old APIs still work as expected.
Applications instrumented for PAPI should continue to work as expected with no
changes.
The major change in PAPI-C is the support of multiple components, or counting 
domains, in addition to the traditional hardware counters found in the cpu. The
goal of this first release of PAPI-C is to provide a stable technology platform
within which to explore the development and implementation of additional
components.
Although a small number of components are provided with this release, the major
objective has been to guarantee that PAPI-C works at least as well as earlier
PAPI releases and on the same range of hardware platforms. We think we have 
achieved that goal.

CHANGES IN PAPI 4.0.0 SINCE PAPI 3.7.2
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------

Enhancements:
-------------
- The perf_events linux kernel interface is supported for POWER and x86 in 
  linux kernels 2.6.31 and above.
- PAPI info now includes information on multicore heirarchy. This is reported
  in the header of many tests.

New Platforms:
-------------
- IBM Blue Gene P has been fully integrated into the code base. It still
  suffers the same quirks and limitations as the earlier pre-release.

Open Issues:
-------------
- Components are invoked from the configure line; Requires PAPI source code
  modifications to add new components.

Experimental:
-------------

Known Bugs:
-----------
- some tests involving overflow and profiling fail with linux perf_events
- multiple event overflow only works for last event enabled on (at least)
  Intel Core2 and Itanium architectures.
- clock speeds on variable speed Intel systems can be misreported, leading to 
  incorrect calculations of mflops
- memory leaks may lead to (rare) seg faults on Pentium4 systems

PAPI 3.7.2 RELEASE NOTES                                            02 Dec 2009
===============================================================================

This file documents changes in recent PAPI releases in inverse chronological
order.

in this directory.

For specific and detailed information on changes made in this release, grep
the ChangeLogP372.txt file for keywords of interest or go directly to the PAPI
cvs tree.


GENERAL NOTES
===============================================================================
This release is an incremental upgrade to PAPI 3.7.1. It fixes a mistake in 
the 3.7.1 release by updating configure to better detect the proper counter
interface in linux kernels. Along the way, it also cleans up a few issues 
found in the 3.7.1 release.

As always, if you identify strange behavior or reproducible bugs, please
contact the PAPI team or visit the PAPI User Forum.

CHANGES IN PAPI 3.7.2 SINCE PAPI 3.7.1
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------
- fixed L3 cache size reporting for AMD Family 10h processors
- fixed std deviation underflow in sdsc2 and sdsc4 tests
- fixed bug in counter assignment for FreeBSD Atom implementation

Enhancements:
-------------
- updated cache tables for Intel Nehalem i7 processors
- configure provides better autodetection of 2.6.31 or 2.6.32 kernels and
  perf_counter interface (in most cases)
- configure provides better detection and autoselection of perfctr or perfmon 
  drivers for linux
- configure and sources have been modified to support perf_counter on
  kernel 2.6.31 and perf_event on kernel 2.6.32
- a papi.spec file has been added to simplify creation of rpms

===============================================================================
PAPI 3.7.1 RELEASE NOTES                                            13 Nov 2009

cvs tree.


GENERAL NOTES
===============================================================================
This release is an incremental upgrade to PAPI 3.7.0. It cleans up several 
issues found in the 3.7.0 release and provides better support for the 
perf_counter interface introduced in Linux kernel 2.6.31.

As always, if you identify strange behavior or reproducible bugs, please
contact the PAPI team or visit the PAPI User Forum.

And visit the PAPI website for the latest updates:
http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/

NOTE: If you are looking for the man pages and other user documentation, look
online. We decided we could provide better and more timely support by 
maintaining just the online documentation. Let us know if you think this is a
bad decision.


CHANGES IN PAPI 3.7.1 SINCE PAPI 3.7.0
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------
- fixed long standing subtle multiplexing bug in which TIDs and PIDs would get
  confused. TIDs would then get lost leading to long term instability.
- fixed unit mask handling in perf_counters
- fixed uninitialized string issue in /proc/cpuinfo parsing
- fixed event reporting errors for various Opteron Family 10h models

Enhancements:
-------------
- FreeBSD support for Intel i7
- cleaned up libpapi.so naming for RedHat rpms
- cleaned up various other issues for rpms per RedHat
- autodetection of 2.6.31 perf_counter interface (in most cases)
- enhanced packaging options in configure to support building either static or 
  shared libraries independently

New Platforms:
-------------
- Support for the perf_counters (PCL: Performance Counters for Linux) interface
  for Linux kernel 2.6.31 and later has been more completely tested on a 
  broader range of platforms, including Opteron, Core2, i7, and POWER.
  It successfully performs basic counting operations and handles many multiplex,
  overflow and profiling situations. It is still not as extensivelytested as the
  perfmon or perfctr interfaces, but is ready for work. Caveat Emptor.

Major Issues:
-------------
- see 3.7.0

Experimental:
-------------

Known Bugs:
-----------
- see 3.7.0

GENERAL NOTES
===============================================================================
This release is a recommended upgrade to PAPI 3.6.x. It addresses a number of 
open issues and introduces support for several new platforms, including Intel
Nehalem (Core i7), Atom, POWER7 and Niagara2.

If you are currently using PAPI 3.6.x or earlier, it is recommended that you 
upgrade to this version.

bad decision.


CHANGES IN PAPI 3.7.0 SINCE PAPI 3.6.2
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------
- many minor bugs fixed in tests and in specific cpu components
- fixed support for Intel CoreDuo (not Core2) broken in PAPI 3.6.x
- fixed library init failure on AIX Power6 when executable names > 32 char long
- fixed avail.F construct that was crashing some versions of gfortran

Enhancements:
-------------
- A new utility has been added: papi_version
- Added 4 new PRESET events to better handle SIMD instructions on Intel cpus:
  PAPI_DP_OPS - counts double precision scalar and vector FP operations
  PAPI_SP_OPS - counts single precision scalar and vector FP operations
  PAPI_VEC_DP - counts double precision vector instructions
  PAPI_VEC_SP - counts single precision vector instructions
- FreeBSD support upgrade and new support for Atom and Intel Core2

New Platforms:
-------------
- Intel Core i7 (Nehalem) support for 7 core counters; no support for 
  Uncore counters
- Intel Atom 
- AMD Opteron Barcelona, Shanghai, Istanbul event table support
- POWER7 support for Linux thanks to IBM
- Sun Niagara2 support thanks to Aachen University, Germany
- Resurrected support for PAPI on Windows; now supports Intel Core2 and Core i7

Major Issues:
-------------
- PAPI for Windows does not support 64-bit versions due to compiler issues.

Experimental:
-------------
- Support for the perf_counters (PCL: Performance Counters for Linux) interface
  is available as a technology pre-release for Linux kernel 2.6.31 and later.
  This has been tested on IBM POWER and Intel Core2 and successfully performs 
  basic counting operations. It has not been stress tested. Caveat Emptor.

Known Bugs:
-----------
- clock speeds are occasionally not reported correctly for systems with
  SpeedStep technology.
- Intel Atom crashes on a small number of standard tests.
