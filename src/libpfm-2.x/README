This package provides a library, called libpfm, which can be used
to develop monitoring tools which exploit the IA-64 Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU). 

This version of libpfm supports BOTH the Itanium (Merced) and Itanium2 (McKinley) processors.

WHAT'S THERE
-------------

	- the library source code including support for Itanium and Itanium2 and generic PMU

	- a set of examples showing how the library can be used

	- a set of header files

	- man pages for all the library entry points

REQUIREMENTS
------------
	- the library and examples ONLY work with a Linux/ia64 2.4.x kernel
	  implementing perfmon v1.x.  This package does not work with any of the
	  2.6.x kernels (use libpfm-3.x for this).
	
INSTALLATION
------------
	- edit config.mk to :
		- update some of the configuration variables
		- make your compiler options
		- select which PMU you want to support. Multiple PMU can be supported by a single
		  library

	- type make
	- type make install

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

	- man pages for all entry points
