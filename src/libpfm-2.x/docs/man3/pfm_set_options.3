.SH NAME
pfm_set_options \- set performance monitoring library debug options
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <perfmon/pfmlib.h>
.sp
.BI "int pfm_set_options(pfmlib_options_t *"opt);
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function can be called at any time to adjust the level
of debug of the library. You can adjust the verbosity 
or the debug level. In both cases, extra output will be
generated on the standard output when the library gets
called. This can be useful to figure out how the PMC
registers are initialized.
.sp
The opt argument is a pointer to a 
.B pfmlib_options_t 
structure which is defined as follows:
.sp
.nf 
typedef struct {
	unsigned int	pfm_debug:1;
	unsigned int	pfm_verbose:1;
} pfmlib_options_t;
.fi
.sp
Setting \fBpfm_debug\fR to 1 will enable debug messages whereas setting
\fBpfm_verbose\fR will enable verbose messages. 
.SH RETURN
The function returns whether or not it was successful.A return
value of \fBPFMLIB_SUCCESS\fR indicates success, otherwise the 
value is the error code.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B PFMLIB_ERR_INVAL 
the argument is invalid, most likely a NULL pointer.
